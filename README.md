<h2>React js</h2>
<p>.
React is an efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React is used to build single-page applications.It breaks down complex UIs into small, isolated code called “components”. By using these components,
React only concerns itself with what you see on the front page of a website.Components are independent and reusable. They can either be JavaScript functions or classes. 
Either way, they both return a piece of code that represents part of a web page. React allows us to create reusable UI components.</p>
